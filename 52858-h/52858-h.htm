<h2><i>Injection of Saline Solutions into the Veins.</i></h2>

<p>The following documents relative to the treatment of cholera by
the copious injection of a saline solution into the veins, communicated
to the Central Board of Health of Great Britain, are of so interesting
a character that we hasten to lay them before our readers;
though we are far from participating in the sanguine estimate of the
curative powers of the remedy, entertained by Drs. Lewins, Latta
and others. The measure has been resorted to in New York, and on
the whole, with but slender success, and the results of trials of it, in
this city, so far as we have been able to obtain authentic information,
have not been very encouraging. Some of the symptoms have been
relieved, but we know as yet of no cure effected by it.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<h3>No. 1.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I conceive it to be my duty to let you know, for the information of the
Central Board of Health, that the great desideratum of restoring the natural
current in the veins and arteries, of improving the colour of the blood, and recovering
the functions of the lungs, in cholera asphyxia, may be accomplished
by injecting a weak saline solution into the veins of the patient. To Dr. Thomas
Latta, of this place, is due the merit of first having recourse to this practice.
He has tried it in six cases, three of which I have seen, and assisted to
treat. The most wonderful and satisfactory effect is the immediate consequence
of the injection. To produce the effect referred to, a large quantity must be
injected&mdash;from <i>five to ten pounds</i> in an adult&mdash;and repeated at longer or shorter
intervals, as the state of the pulse, and other symptoms, may indicate. Whenever
the pulse fails, more fluid ought to be thrown in, to produce an effect
upon it, without regard to quantity. In one of the cases I have referred to,
120 <i>ounces</i> were injected at once, and repeated to the amount of 330 ounces in
twelve hours. In another, 376 ounces were thrown into the veins between
Sunday, at 11 o’clock, A. M., and this day (Tuesday) at 4 P. M.; that is, in the
course of 53 hours, upwards of 31 pounds!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>The solution that was used consisted of two drachms of muriate, and two
scruples of carbonate, of soda, to sixty ounces of water. It was at the temperature
of 108 or 110 degrees.</p>

<p>The apparatus employed in injecting was merely one of Reid’s common syringes,
(the fluid being put into a vessel rather deep and narrow,) with a
small pipe fitted, that it might easily be introduced into an incision in the veins
of the usual size that is made in bleeding. It may, however, be well to keep in
mind, that, in the event of the operation being frequently repeated, it may be
adviseable to inject by different veins.</p>

<p>I forbear at present to enter further into the particulars; nor have we had
sufficient experience to speak decisively on the subject. I may, however,
mention, that the idea of having recourse to this remedy in cholera, occurred
to Dr. Latta, from being convinced, (which I am also,) that the evacuations upwards
and downwards are in reality the serum of the blood; that it is the duty
of the physician to replace it, as speedily as possible, by injecting a fluid, as similar
to the serum as can be formed artificially, directly into the veins, which
has been done here with wonderful, and, so far as we can yet judge, excellent
effect. An immediate return of the pulse, an improvement in the respiration
and in the voice, an evolution of heat, an improvement in the appearance of the
patient, with a feeling of comfort, are the immediate effects. The quantity necessary
to be injected will probably be found to depend upon the quantity of
serum lost&mdash;the object of the practice being to place the patient in nearly his ordinary
state, as to the quantity of blood circulating in the vessels.&mdash;I have, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>No. 2.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I did myself the honour to address a letter to you lately, on the effects
of injecting a saline solution into the veins of a patient labouring under cholera.
We have not frequent opportunities of trying this, which I denominate, admirable
remedy, as the disease is decidedly less frequent here; but I have seen it
employed in two other cases, in the course of the last two days, with the same
excellent effect. Sixty ounces are generally thrown in at once, and repeated at
the end of three or four hours. In a case to-day, where I saw fifty-eight ounces
injected, (being the third time of performing the operation,) the patient’s pulse,
at the commencement, was 180, very small, and very feeble. She was excessively
restless, with a feeling of great weakness and tormenting thirst. Before
twelve ounces were injected, the pulse began to improve; it became fuller and
slower, and it continued to improve until, after 58 ounces had been injected, it
was down to 110. Before I left the patient, (a woman,) her condition was altogether
amazingly amended. There was a fine glow and a slight perspiration
on her face; the veins on the back of her head were well filled; the restlessness
was removed, the feeling of excessive weakness gone, and the thirst ceased.
The pulse was under 100, free, full, and soft! Verily, sir, this is an astonishing
method of medication, and I predict will lead to wonderful changes and improvements
in the practice of medicine! I have addressed you upon the subject,
as the organ, from your high official station, of disseminating a knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
of the extraordinary facts referred to. It will, of course, give me great pleasure
to enter further into particulars upon any particular point on which you may require
information, in reference to the cases that have come under my observation.&mdash;I
have, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To W. Maclean, Esq.</span> &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>In the hands of a man of ordinary dexterity, the common injecting apparatus
alluded to in my last will be found to answer the purpose perfectly well; but
if the practice I recommend is, as I hope it will be, generally adopted, it will,
I conceive, be expedient to advise that a regular and perfect transfusion apparatus
be used; at all events, to warn those who inject to beware of allowing
air to get into the vein. The tubes, of course, must be filled with fluid, as well
as the pipe in the vein, before commencing, and considerably more fluid than
it is intended to use ought to be in the vessel from which it is pumped.</p>

<h3>No. 3.</h3>

<p class="right"><i>Leith, May 23d, 1832.</i></p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;My friend, Dr. Lewins, has communicated to me your wish for a detailed
account of my method of treating cholera by saline injection into the veins, with
which I now most willingly comply. My scope for observation, since I commenced
this treatment, has been too limited to allow me to be very copious on
the subject, but I think I can adduce sufficient proof to the unprejudiced, not
only of its safety, but of its unquestionable utility. I have never yet seen one
bad symptom attributable to it, and I have no doubt that it will be found, when
judiciously applied, to be one of the most powerful, and one of the safest remedies
yet used in the second stage of cholera, or that hopeless state of collapse
to which the system is reduced.</p>

<p>Before entering into particulars, I beg leave to premise, that the plan which
I have put in practice was suggested to me on reading in The Lancet, the review
of Dr. O’Shaughnessy’s report on the chemical pathology of malignant
cholera, by which it appears that in that disease there is a very great deficiency
both of the water and saline matter of the blood. On which deficiency, the
thick, black, cold state of the vital fluid depends, which evidently produces
most of the distressing symptoms of that very fearful complaint, and is, doubtless,
often the cause of death. In this opinion I am abundantly borne out by
the phenomena produced on repletion by venous injection.</p>

<p>So soon as I learnt the result of Dr. O’Shaughnessy’s analysis, I attempted to
restore the blood to its natural state, by injecting copiously into the larger intestines,
warm water, holding in solution the requisite salts, and also administered
quantities from time to time by the mouth, trusting that the power of absorption
might not be altogether lost; but by these means I produced, in no case,
any permanent benefit; but, on the contrary, I thought the tormina, vomiting,
and purging, were much aggravated thereby, to the further reduction of the
little remaining strength of the patient; finding thus, that such, in common with
all the ordinary means in use, was either useless or hurtful, I at length resolved
to throw the fluid immediately into the circulation. In this, having no precedent
to direct me, I proceeded with much caution. The first subject of experiment
was an aged female, on whom all the usual remedies had been fully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
tried, without producing one good symptom; the disease, uninterrupted, holding
steadily on its course. She had apparently reached the last moments of her
earthly existence, and now nothing could injure her&mdash;indeed, so entirely was
she reduced, that I feared I should be unable to get my apparatus ready ere she
expired. Having inserted a tube into the basilic vein, cautiously&mdash;anxiously I
watched the effects; ounce after ounce was injected, but no visible change was
produced. Still persevering, I thought she began to breathe less laboriously;
soon the sharpened features, and sunken eye, and fallen jaw, pale and cold,
bearing the manifest impress of death’s signet, began to glow with returning
animation; the pulse, which had long ceased, returned to the wrist; at first small
and quick, by degrees it became more and more distinct, fuller, slower, and firmer,
and in the short space of half an hour, when six pints had been injected, she
expressed in a firm voice that she was free from all uneasiness, actually became
jocular, and fancied all she needed was a little sleep; her extremities were
warm, and every feature bore the aspect of comfort and health. This being my
first case, I fancied my patient secure, and from my great need of a little repose,
left her in charge of the hospital surgeon; but I had not been long gone, ere the
vomiting and purging recurring, soon reduced her to her former state of debility.
I was not apprised of the event, and she sunk in five and a half hours
after I left her. As she had previously been of a sound constitution, I have no
doubt the case would have issued in complete reaction, had the remedy, which
had already produced such effect, been repeated.</p>

<p>Not having by me the number of <span class="smcap">The Lancet</span> containing Dr. O’Shaughnessy’s
analyses, I adopted that of Dr. Marcet, only allowing a smaller proportion of
saline ingredients. This I now find to be considerably less than natural, according
to the more recent analyses. I dissolved from two to three drachms of
muriate of soda, and two scruples of the sub-carbonate of soda in six pints of water,
and injected it at temperature 112° Fah. If the temperature is so low as a
hundred, it produces an extreme sense of cold, with rigors; and if it reaches
115°, it suddenly excites the heart, the countenance becomes flushed, and the
patient complains of great weakness. At first there is but little felt by the patient,
and symptoms continue unaltered, until the blood, mingled with the injected
liquid, becomes warm and fluid; the improvement in the pulse and countenance
is almost simultaneous; the cadaverous expression gradually gives place
to appearances of returning animation, the horrid oppression at the præcordia
goes off, the sunken turned up eye, half covered by the palpebræ, becomes
gradually fuller, till it sparkles with the brilliancy of health, the livid hue disappears,
the warmth of the body returns, and it regains its natural colour&mdash;words
are no more uttered in whispers, the voice first acquires its true cholera tone,
and ultimately its wonted energy, and the poor patient, who but a few minutes
before was oppressed with sickness, vomiting, and burning thirst, is suddenly
relieved from every distressing symptom; blood now drawn exhibits on exposure
to air its natural florid hue.</p>

<p>Such symptoms, so gratifying both to the sick and the physician, must never
allow the latter to relax in his care&mdash;the utmost vigilance is still necessary. At
first the change is so great, that he may fancy all is accomplished, and leave his
post for a while. The diarrhœa recurring, he may find his patient, after the
lapse of two or three hours, as low as ever. As soon as reaction by the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
injection is produced, mild warm stimulants, such as weak gin toddy, mixed with
some astringent, should be freely and assiduously administered. An attempt
should be made to fill the colon with some astringent fluid. That such is requisite,
is evident from the watery diarrhœa returning with violence, and if not
restrained, death will ultimately make sure of his victim, therefore, so soon as
the pulse fails, and the features again shrink, the venous injection must be repeated,
taking care that the fluid in use retains its proper temperature. The
injection should be carried on very slowly, unless the patient is much exhausted,
when it may be used more rapidly at first, until a little excitement is produced,
after which it should not exceed two or three ounces per minute, and now is
the time for the exhibition of astringents by the mouth, which will be retained;
for in general the sickness entirely leaves during the operation.</p>

<p>Such remedies must be persisted in; and repeated as symptoms demand, or
until reaction is permanently established. I have witnessed no violent symptoms
accompanying the rapid injection of the fluid; but I have thought that the hasty
repletion of the system was followed by great increase of the evacuations, and,
consequently, a more sudden depression of the powers of life. The quantity
to be injected depends on the effect produced, and the repetition on the demands
of the system, which generally vary according to the violence of the
diarrhœa; the greater the degree of collapse, the greater will be the quantity
needed, though not uniformly, for a very slight loss produces much depression
in some systems; hence there is often great collapse, without much vomiting,
purging, or cutaneous discharge.</p>

<p>Although in every case, even the most desperate, the cholera symptoms were
removed, some of my cases failed, which I attributed to one or other of the following
causes&mdash;either the quantity injected was too small, or its effects were
rendered abortive by extensive organic disease, or its application was too late.</p>

<p>I have already given an instance where deficiency in quantity was the cause
of failure, which I will now contrast with one in which it was used freely. A
female, aged fifty, very destitute, but previously in good health, was on the
13th instant, at four A. M., seized with cholera in its most violent form, and by
half-past nine was reduced to a most hopeless state. The pulse was quite gone,
even in the axilla, and strength so much exhausted, that I had resolved not to
try the effects of the injection, conceiving the poor woman’s case to be hopeless,
and that the failure of the experiment might afford the prejudiced and the
illiberal an opportunity to stigmatize the practice; however, I at length thought
I would give her a chance, and in the presence of Drs. Lewins and Craigie, and
Messrs. Sibson and Paterson, I injected one hundred and twenty ounces, when,
like the effects of magic, instead of the pallid aspect of one whom death had
sealed as his own, the vital tide was restored, and life and vivacity returned;
but diarrhœa recurred, and in three hours she again sunk. One hundred and
twenty ounces more were injected with the same good effect. In this case
three hundred and thirty ounces were so used in twelve hours, when reaction
was completely reëstablished; and in forty-eight hours she smoked her pipe
free from distemper. She was then, for better accommodation, carried to the hospital,
where probably, from contagion, slight typhoid symptoms were produced.
She is now, however, convalescent.</p>

<p>The second cause of want of success is the presence of organic disease; this,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
probably, renders the possessor very liable to attacks of cholera; and the latent
evil, which previously gave but little uneasiness, suffers aggravation in all its
symptoms, more especially after reaction has been produced, and has evidently,
in many cases, been the cause of death. A delicate young female, of strumous
habits, who had been for some years subject to pectoral complaints, was rescued
from a state of collapse by the injection of sixty ounces of the saline fluid, administered
in separate portions, within the space of twelve hours. After lingering
for ten days she died; the heart was found in a state of atrophy, covered
with strong evidence of the existence of ancient disease, and floating in eight
ounces of pus. In another case every internal organ was diseased; some of them
so much so, that it was astonishing the individual lived so long.</p>

<p>The third case of the occasional want of success, is the late application of
the remedy. Hitherto I have had opportunity of injecting only in extreme
cases, after every other means had entirely failed, cases which apparently soon
would have proved fatal. Here the obstacles to be overcome have been of no
ordinary kind, notwithstanding the result of the practice is of the most encouraging
nature, and the number of cases now convalescent or doing well highly
gratifying. In every fatal case we have had an opportunity of examining, independent
of organic disease, I have found a large quantity of fibrine in the
cavities of the heart, especially on the right side, where it had extended from
the auricle through the ventricle in the pulmonary artery. Such deposition
must have formed a certain obstacle to recovery, and is, no doubt, from the interruption
it gives to the pulmonary circulation, the cause of the heavings of
the chest, and the inordinate action perceptible in the centre of circulation many
hours before death. Now surely it is reasonable to suppose, that if this, the
most simple of all remedies, were applied early, before the blood drained of its
water has collected in the larger vessels, in fact before such fibrinous depositions
have taken place in the cavities of the heart, is it not reasonable to suppose
that such would be entirely prevented?</p>

<p>But not only is early injection adviseable on this account, not only is stagnation
of the blood prevented by it, and the laborious breathing, and the præcordial
oppression, the intense sickness, the burning thirst, the extreme depression of
the vital powers, and the chances of aggravating chronic disease, or of producing
new organic lesion, in a great measure avoided: but it is rational to suppose
that the consecutive fever will be rendered much milder, and that this is
the case, is supported by my own experience, even though the remedy has
not been applied earlier, indeed the fact is very evident. In an ordinary attack
of cholera, much fluid is lost; and if the individual is so fortunate as to get out
of the stage of collapse, if consecutive fever of typhoid type comes on, the system,
left to its own resources to replace the lost serum, must be but ill fitted
for the task, for the debility is extreme, absorption goes on slowly, the fever
will be much aggravated by the irritation of internal congestion; local inflammation
will thereby be produced, and the chance of recovery will be but small.
Much of this evil is to be mitigated or entirely avoided by injection into the
veins, of which circumstance I can adduce living instances; and where the patient,
who had been injected, has sunk under organic disease, the usual marks
of congestion are not perceptible.</p>

<p>The apparatus I have used, is Reid’s patent syringe, having a small silver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
tube attached to the extremity of the flexible injecting tube. The syringe must
be quite perfect, so as to avoid the risk of injecting air; the saline fluid should
never be injected oftener than <i>once</i> into the same orifice, and the vein should
be treated with much delicacy to avoid phlebitis. The wound should be poulticed
and carefully watched, if it does not heal by the first intention.</p>

<h2><i>Origin and Progress of Cholera at Albany.</i></h2>

<p>The following report made by the medical staff of Albany to the
Board of Health, furnishes some interesting information relative to
the origin of the epidemic, and the character of the diseases which
preceded its appearance in that city.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In presenting to the Board of Health the following tables, showing the
bills of mortality of this city from the 22d ult., when the board directed the
deaths to be recorded, up to this day, we deem it our duty to make some remarks
relative to the health of the city during the above period, and likewise
in relation to our future prospects, and the measures we consider useful to accelerate
the departure of the pestilence from among us.</p>

<p>“We stated in our last report to the board, that immediately prior to the breaking
out of the epidemic, our city was unusually healthy. Until about the 20th
of June, few diseases prevailed, and the mortality was less than common. From
the 22d of June to the 3d of July, only eleven deaths occurred&mdash;of those, six
were children. In a population of twenty-six thousand, an average of less than
one death a day for near two weeks, indicates a degree of health almost without
a parallel. From the 30th of June to the 3d of July, <i>not one single death was
reported</i>. It was, however, but the calm which precedes the storm. All other
diseases gave way to the silent but the irresistible march of the epidemic.</p>

<p>“Although but few deaths took place from the 20th of June to the 3d of July,
there was considerable sickness; and experienced physicians foresaw the coming
danger, in the usual prevalence of diarrhœa, and common cholera morbus&mdash;hence
it was that your board was urged to make all ready&mdash;to be prepared with
hospitals, physicians, nurses, &amp;c. and to this timely warning, and the preparations
made in consequence, we may, under Providence, attribute the limited
ravages of this fell pestilence.</p>

<p>“On the 3d day of July, the epidemic assumed its malignant and characteristic
form. From that time until now, it has maintained its residence among us.
For the first week it gradually extended, and during the second it has been
rather stationary, the number attacked varying a little from day to day and but
little.</p>

<p>“It is now a fortnight since the first deaths took place. The number of
cases reported within that period is two hundred and forty-five, and the deaths
seventy-two&mdash;or a little over one-quarter of the whole. It must however be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
recollected, that during the same time hundreds had been attacked with <i>Cholerine</i>,
or the slightest influences of the epidemic. None of these have been
reported, <i>because by timely aid, the disease, in its more formidable shape, was prevented</i>.
We can, we believe, say with truth, that few have entirely escaped the
influence of the disease.</p>

<p>“From a consideration of all the circumstances connected with the visitation
of Providence, we think our citizens have great cause for thankfulness, that we
thus far suffered so little. Compared to our neighbours of Canada, we have
suffered less than we had cause to anticipate. The disease has been among us
for a fortnight; has passed all over the city, and in one form or other has affected
more or less persons of all classes, and yet the deaths have not much exceeded
five in a day, whilst at Quebec and Montreal, in a population not much exceeding
ours, the deaths some days exceeded one hundred, when the disease had
not been so long among them as it has been with us. From the history of the
disease in other countries, and the circumstances connected with its progress in
this city, we would fain indulge the hope, that it has already spent its venom,
and that we shall ere long be free from it entirely. For the last two days, notwithstanding
the number of cases reported and the high state of mortality, we
are inclined to believe that we see, in the character of the prevailing disease,
indications of returning health.</p>

<p>“We have as yet, had no cause to change our opinion respecting the nature
of the prevailing disease&mdash;we consider it essentially epidemic. It continues to
attack people in different parts of the city, and had not been traced from one
person to another, as might have been done were its progress dependent on
contagion. It is true, in some houses, several persons have been attacked and
died; but this only shows that similar causes produce similar effects in individuals
placed in like circumstances&mdash;all were equally exposed to the local and
general causes which engender this disease. The disease <i>may</i>, under certain
circumstances, be contagious, but no very striking instances of the kind has yet
come to our knowledge in this city.</p>

<p>“We cannot reprehend in too strong language, the cold-hearted and inhuman
conduct of many of our people, to the unfortunate victims of cholera.
They are too often abandoned to their fate, even their friends being afraid to do
to them the ordinary offices of charity. Were they labouring under the plague
of the Levant they would not be looked upon with more dread. All this is
folly. The risk of taking the disease from the sick is little or nothing; much
more is to be dreaded from foul air by which the disease is engendered. The
first care of friends should be, not to run away, but to take the sick into more
healthy and airy lodgings.</p>

<p>“We would also protest against the indecent haste with which the scarcely
cold remains of the dead are hurried to their last abode, without a neighbour to
follow, or a friend to mourn. Such conduct is discreditable to the character of
a Christian people. We trust that we shall not again have to complain of similar
indifference to the performance of the duties of charity and humanity.</p>

<p>“To the members of the medical profession, and particularly its younger
members, we willingly award due credit for their attention and diligence, under
circumstances of no usual difficulty.</p>

<p>“We would again most earnestly entreat our citizens not to neglect to apply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
for medical aid the moment diarrhœa, or sick stomach and head-ache take place.
We have not yet known one instance in which the disease in its malignant form,
was not preceded by one or more of these symptoms, for some hours, if not
days; and we have not seen or heard of a single instance where these premonitory
symptoms were properly attended to, an attack was not prevented. It
cannot be too strongly or too often impressed upon the minds of our citizens,
that cholera, in its early stages, is easily cured; but that when neglected, in a
majority of cases, no human aid will avail. Almost all the deaths have occurred
in persons of intemperate habits, and of broken constitutions. A few estimable
citizens have fallen victims to it, but these were either aged and infirm, or had
neglected the premonitory symptoms, or had tampered with medicines, without
proper advice.</p>

<p>“To our constituted authorities we would recommend the most assiduous attention
to cleanliness in our streets, along our wharves and docks; to our citizens,
strict attention to cleanliness in their houses and persons, to pay due attention
to dress, avoid exposure to the night air, and observe strict temperance,
not only in <i>drink</i>, but in <i>food</i>. We would caution them against the free use of
<i>fruit</i>, <i>ripe</i> or <i>unripe</i>, and the employment of Glauber or Epsom salts as medicines.
Several cases of cholera have been brought on by their operation. If
due attention be paid to all these precautions, we have every reason to hope
that the epidemic will soon cease to prevail among us.</p>

<h2><i>Board of Health, New York, July 20th, 1832.</i></h2>

<p class="indent3"><span class="smcap">To Walter Bowne</span>, Esq. President, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Sir&mdash;I have the honour to transmit to your Board of Health, an
additional report of the Committee appointed to inquire into the
history and origin of the disease at the Bellevue Alms-house, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="right">ALEX. H. STEVENS, M. D. President.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The committee consisting of Drs. Bailey, Macneven, and A. L. Anderson, to
whom was referred the inquiry into the origin of the malignant cholera in the
Alms-house and the different institutions connected with it, further report: the
Penitentiary, situated about five hundred feet from the Alms-house, and containing
three classes of criminals, have no communication with one another;
but the Bridewell and Penitentiary prisoners have a common stairway to their
apartments; and the yards of the Female State and Female Penitentiary prisoners
are separated by a high open picket fence, near to which the Penitentiary prisoners
pass to and from their work-house, and on the opposite side of the Female
State prisoners yard, and at a little distance is situated the Cholera Hospital,
first opened on the 5th or 6th of July. In this building were confined, on the
1st of July, fifty-four Female State, about one hundred and twenty Female Penitentiary,
and about fifty Bridewell prisoners; and the first person who had
malignant cholera in that prison was Ann Smith, taken up at the Five Points,
and sent there July 2d&mdash;she sickened on the 5th, and died the next day, and
on the 7th, four more Female Penitentiary prisoners had the disease. On the
8th of July, all the remaining prisoners of this class were sent to Blackwell’s
Island, and put into a fresh white-washed building prepared for them. The
removal of those persons to a healthy residence, and an unrestrained exercise
in the open country air, appear to have checked the development of that disease
among them, for not until the 10th did any of them sicken, when four of
them were taken with that disease, and since then seven more. Dr. Spring,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
the physician stationed there, informed us that the disease had become milder
since their removal to the Island, two only having died of thirteen patients,
and the remaining eleven, visited by us, were doing well, except one.</p>

<p>The first State prisoner had that disease on the 9th of July, and eight more
on the 12th and 13th, four each day; and since that time five more, the greater
part of whom have died. They are all in one very large apartment, having
three tier of windows on one side only, but the three stories are one open space
from the top to the bottom of the building.</p>

<p>The first two cases occurred in the Bridewell class also on the 9th, the next
on the 11th instant; since then, six more have had the disease.</p>

<p>When at Blackwell’s Island yesterday afternoon, pursuing our inquiries respecting
the Female Penitentiary prisoners, sent there from Bellevue, we considered
it appertaining to the duty assigned to us, to extend our inquiry to the
occurrences relating to the same subject, which happened on that Island, the
institution there being a part of the Bellevue establishment. We were informed
by Dr. Spring, the physician stationed there, that the first case of malignant
cholera which occurred on the Island, was an Alms-house pauper, who slept
there, but worked on the Long Island farms; he was permitted to go as far as
Brooklyn, July 1st, but he frolicked in the city all the next day, returned at
night to Blackwell’s Island, and slept out of doors all night, and sickened and
died July 3d&mdash;no other case took place there until the 11th, (three days after
the Female Penitentiary prisoners were removed from Bellevue,) when three
persons sickened and died the same day; one, a very feeble black man, aged
sixty-five; another, a black lad, who had been much reduced by medical treatment
for rheumatism&mdash;both patients in the hospital, and able to take exercise
out of doors. Their building is about one hundred yards from that occupied
by the Female Penitentiary prisoners. The third, a white pauper, aged sixty-five,
who worked on the Long Island farms, but slept on Blackwell’s Island,
formerly in the shanty now occupied by the sick blacks; but some days before
he sickened, he slept in a small building at a considerable distance from his
former lodging place; but he not being under confinement, would go to any
part of the Island when unobserved, and without hindrance to the outside of
the Black Hospital.&mdash;Since then, three blacks have had that disease.</p>

<p>We were also informed by Dr. Spring, that no case of malignant cholera had
occurred among the two hundred and eight male Penitentiary prisoners&mdash;that
a lad, aged sixteen, who frequently complained of being unwell, died on the
13th inst., after three or four hours sickness of common cholera. Those men
are employed in the open air, and their prison is in the most perfect order; the
air within was as free from any impure smell as the atmosphere without. We were
informed by Col. Woodruff, the superintendent, that it was in contemplation to
remove the Bridewell prisoners from Bellevue to this prison&mdash;and asked our
opinion as to the propriety of the measure; we give it as our opinion, that as
there was already a large number of men now confined there, and room only
for about thirty more, that the crowding of the prison at this time, and especially
from places where the malignant cholera existed, would be exposing the
health of the prisoners to some hazard.</p>

<p>We were also informed by John Targee, Esq., one of the Commissioners of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
the Alms-house, that a boy, whose parents had both died in Laurens street with
the malignant cholera, was sent from there in the beginning of July, to the
house on Long Island Farms, where there are a large number of pauper boys;
he sickened and died of that disease the day after, and no case of that disease
has since occurred.</p>

<p>The foregoing being all the facts which have come to our knowledge after
a strict examination, are respectfully submitted.</p>

<p class="right">JOS. BAYLEY.</p>

</div>

<hr />

<h2><i>Magendie’s Treatment of Cholera.</i></h2>

<p>M. Magendie’s success in the treatment of cholera has been vaunted
in many of the journals, and we have been repeatedly applied to
for information respecting the remedies prescribed by him. His treatment
consisted in the administration during the cold stage of the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>1st. For common drink&mdash;℞. Infus. chamomil. ℔iv.; acet. ammon.
℥ij.; sacch. alb. ℔j M.</p>

<p>2d. Half a glass every hour of the following punch&mdash;℞. Infus. flor.
Tiliæ Europeæ, ℔iv.; limon. iv.; alcohol, ℔j.; sacch. alb. ℔j. M.</p>

<p>3d. From time to time he gives half a glass of the following&mdash;℞.
Vinum calefac. ℔ij.; tinct. cannel. ℥ij; sacch. alb. ℥ij. M.</p>

<p>By these stimulants, reaction was sometimes induced, and it was
at once concluded that the patient was cured. But violent reaction
is not less dangerous than collapse, and M. Magendie’s patients relieved
from the latter condition by internal stimulants, soon exhibited
evidences of congestion of the brain or digestive organs, which resisted,
for the most part, general and local bleeding, cold to the head,
and the most active revulsives to the feet. The patient became delirious,
coma supervened, and death closed the scene.</p>

<p>It is shown by authentic documents in our possession, that the result
of M. Magendie’s treatment was not less unfortunate than that
of his colleagues; he lost more than one-half of his patients.</p>

<p>A careful examination of the results of the various modes of treatment
adopted in India, Russia, Poland, Germany, Great Britain and
France, has satisfied us that the internal administration of powerful
stimulants in large doses, in the collapsed stage of cholera, has been
eminently injurious, and such appears to have been ultimately the
conviction of nearly all the practitioners who resorted to them.
Panic struck, with the utter state of prostration of patients in the
collapse of cholera, physicians appear every where to have at first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
been led to administer the most powerful stimulants in large and repeated
doses, to rouse the action of the heart. Recovered from their
first surprise, and admonished by their ill success, and by the violent
and uncontrollable reaction sometimes induced, these remedies were
subsequently abandoned, or only applied externally, and with incomparably
better results.</p>

<h2><i>Liability of Negroes to Cholera.</i></h2>

<p>An impression appears somehow or other to have got abroad that
negroes are not liable to be attacked with cholera; such a notion,
however, has no foundation. In New York, it has been observed that
they have enjoyed no greater immunity than the whites, and the natives
of India, whose constitution much resembles that of the negro,
were more liable to cholera than Europeans. There is ample grounds
for fearing that the disease will be productive of terrible mortality
among the slaves of the southern states, and proper measures of hygiene
should be promptly adopted; and on the very first symptoms of
derangement of the digestive organs, remedial measures immediately
resorted to.</p>

<hr />

<h2><i>Cholera at New York.</i></h2>

<p>It affords us pleasure to notice that the cholera is abating in our
sister city. During the last few days, the number of cases have considerably
diminished, and though accidental causes may occasionally
interrupt their constant decrease, it is manifest that the epidemic
has reached its height and is on the decline.</p>

even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
